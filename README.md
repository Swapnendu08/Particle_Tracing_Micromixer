# Particle_Tracing_Micromixer
It is a Time Dependent CFD project of tracing micro-particles in a Micromixer using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS simulation Software which solves the partial differential equation and gives us the results like Velocity and Contour Profile,Pressure Profile, Particle Tracing Profile etc 

The comsole file is too big to upload,that's why a comsole file without results is being uploaded.
To see the results and for detailed analysis
